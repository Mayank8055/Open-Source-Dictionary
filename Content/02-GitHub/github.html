      GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service with a graphical interface. It is the largest coding community in the planet. When you publish a piece of code or a project on GitHub, it gets a lot of attention. Programmers may discover source codes in a variety of languages and make and monitor modifications using Git, a command-line interface.</p>
