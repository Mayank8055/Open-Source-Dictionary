      Version control systems are a group of software tools that aid in the recording of changes to files by keeping track of code changes.</p>
      <p>A software product is created collaboratively by a group of developers who may be based in different places and each contributes to a certain set of functionality/features. As a result, they modified the source code in order to contribute to the product (either by adding or removing). A version control system is a type of software that aids the development team in effectively communicating and managing(tracking) any changes made to the source code, as well as information such as who made the change and what it was.Every contributor who made the modifications has their own branch, and the changes aren&#39;t merged into the original source code until all of them have have been evaluated. Once all of the changes have been green indicated, they are merged into the main source code. It not only manages source code but also boosts productivity by streamlining the development process.
