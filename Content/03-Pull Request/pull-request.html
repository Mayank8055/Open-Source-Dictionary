      Pull requests allow you to notify others about changes you&#39;ve made to a branch in a GitHub repository. You can debate and review possible modifications with collaborators and make follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch after a pull request is submitted.</p>
      <p>A pull request is a Git event in which a contributor requests that a Git repository&#39;s maintainer examine code that they want to incorporate into a project. You&#39;ll also learn how to clone a GitHub repository to your local machine so that you may make changes to the code before publishing it to your forked repository.
